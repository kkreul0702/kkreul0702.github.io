										<h4>The analysis</h4>
										
									</header>
									
									<p> The s-channel single top production has the smallest cross-section of the top production channels. That means in the vast amount of data from the ATLAS detector,
										only a tiny fraction (less than 5%) is what we are looking for. In german you say: "die Nadel im Heuhaufen suchen" which literally translates to "searching the needle in the haystack".
										The question of the analysis is: "Is there an s-channel single top contribution in the data?".

										Are you ready for an exciting story about searching for the "needle in the haystack" of particle physics data? In this case the needle is the s-channel single top production. 
										The theory predicts that this signal channel contributes less than 5 % of the data events.

										<summary>Introduction to the physics of the project</summary>
										<p>
											It starts with a bottle of hydrogen.
										The hydrogen consists of a proton and an electron. The electron is removed and the proton is accelerated to 6.5 TeV (99 % speed of light).
										Inside the ATLAS detector two accelerated protons collide and since their kinetic energy (energy from their speed) can 
										be transformed into mass (That's the message of the famous equation E=mc^2), several new particles are produced.
										
										The proton is not a fundamental particle. It consists of gluons and quarks. When they collide top quarks are dominantly produced in pairs. A single top quark 
										is produced by the weak interaction which is (as the name suggests) weaker and therefore the process is less likely. The s-channel single top process is predicted by the Standard Model
										 (the right now accepted theory of particle physics). However, this phenomenon has yet to be discovered in proton-proton collisions due to the significant challenges it presents in the analysis.

										<h5>Data Exploration</h5>
									</header>
									<p> 
										To start, we explored the vast amount of data from the ATLAS detector, comparing it to Monte Carlo simulations, which provided our theoretical predictions. 
										Our dataset was validated by producing plots of kinematic variables, revealing the signal's tiny contribution compared to the background.

										<h5>Multivariate Analysis</h5>
									</header>	
									<p>
										To separate the signal from the background, we employed a powerful multivariate analysis technique called the Matrix Element Method (MEM), which outperforms other methods like neural nets or boosted decision trees in this use case. 
										The Neyman-Pearson Lemma motivated this method, and our input MEM discriminant plot demonstrated its effectiveness in separating signal from background.

										<h5>Data Modelling</h5>
									</header>
									<p>
										Next, I built a statistical model of the data, and by maximizing the likelihood of the model, I extracted the parameter of interest. 
										The goal is to reach a 5 sigma confidence level, which is the ATLAS defined threshold for a discovery. Although I can't reveal the analysis result yet, we're optimistic about our approach.
									</p>


									<p>
										We continuously looked for ways to improve our analysis, and we discovered that the 2j-vs-3j ratio method was an excellent option. 
										As you can see in the ROC curve, 
										by setting the tunable parameter to 0.65, the algorithm's performance can be improved.

									<p>
										I didn't stop at the Matrix Element Method (MEM) for this analysis. I also explored the idea of using a neural network with an intermediate MEM result as input to further improve the results.
